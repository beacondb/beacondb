# beacondb

[beaconDB](https://beacondb.net/) aims to be an alternative to Mozilla Location Services that offers public domain dumps of its WiFi database.

When [Mozilla Location Services shut down](https://github.com/mozilla/ichnaea/issues/2065), it wasn't able to publish the massive amount of access points its users had collected due to legal and privacy concerns. beaconDB obfuscates the data it releases so that it is not possible to reasonably estimate the location of a single device.
